Professional Engineering and EGBC:

Professionalism:
	Attitudes and behaviours: be a good person
	EGBC: "fairness, courtesy and good faith" "truth, honesty and trustworthiness and safeguard human life and welfare and the environment"
	Companies: code of conduct, not universal (ex: confidentiality, conflict of interests)
Roles and Responsibilities:
	Generally: 
		Professionalism
		EGBC Code of Ethics
	Specific: 
		Protection of the Public: minimize likelihood and impact
		Serving the Public Interests: benefit public in projects
	Others: 
		Not in Code (ex: volunteering)
	Competing Stakeholders Interests:
		Provide informed options for decision-makers
Professional Engineering:
	Building + acquiring knowledge
	Origins of professional engineering, 3 key developments:
		1. Printing press: spread knowledge
		2. Industrial rev: technology advances
		3. Organization and regulation
	In Canada:
		1920's: Provicial organizations (ex: EGBC) + laws (provincial)
		Engineers Canada: federal org
			Accreditation board: assess academics
			Qualification board: 
	In BC:
		1920: Engineering Profession's Act
		EGBC regulate by licensing P.Eng, self-regulate
	Regulated differently worldwide
		Self vs gov't regulated
EGBC:
	Council: 13 elected, 4 lay person appointed, faculty
	CEO and Registrar operate day to day
	Regulatory roles:
		Register people as P.Eng
		Spot check, investigate, discipline, enforcement
		Liason with Engineers Canada, foresters, architects, technologists, etc
	Other roles:
		Make Practice Guidelines, promote Organizational Quality Management
		Promotion, advocacy, seminars, etc
	Current changes:
		Mount Polley failure (oof)
		Mandatory continued prof dev, Superintendent of Professional Governance, etc etc
	Memberships:
		Becoming P.Eng:
			Citizen or PR, academics ok, 4 years experience, PPE, English
			Benefits: employment, practice (stamp), title + prestige, engagement
		EIT: have academics, working to 4 years exp, under P.Eng supervision
		Other memberships:
			Engineering Licensee, non practicing P.Eng, non-resident licensee, inter-association/national, provisional member
Iron Ring:
	Reminder: obligations, ethics, humility
	Isaacson's past advice (lol):
		1. Verify big picture
		2. Expect unexpected
		3. Don't be ruber stamp
		
Conflicts of Interest

Conflict of Interest:
	Define: professional has professional duties vs special interests
		Professional duties: standards, confidentiality, impartial, fiduciary, 3rd parties affected
		Special interests: self-interest, family, group, emotional
	Avoid because:
		Damage career, employer, profession 
		Jail

Conflict of interest is not:
	Conflicting interests (professional interests come first in company time)
	Conflicting legitimate obligations (public vs employer)
	Ethical dilemma (personal morals vs professional duties)	
Types of Conflict of Interest:
		Actual (clear cut)
		Potential (series of events lead to)
		Apparent (looks like, but may not be) 
		
Mental process:
	Self interests = automatic: 
		Effortless, involuntary
		Latent bias
	Professional duties = controlled
	Conflict of interest = automatic vs controlled = inevitable
	
What to do:
	Avoid, disclose to all, recuse
	EGBC: avoid, and disclose to employer if can't avoid
	Disclosure:
		Doesn't elimiate COI: bias still exist
		Doesn't mitigate COI: client can't differenciate good and bad advice
		Does show unobjectivity more clearly
