Ethics - some basic concepts:

Ethical dilemma
	Golden rule, consistency principle, don't tell you what to do
Need ethical norm
	1. Utilitarianism
		Based on result
		Benefit measurement is subjective, possible injustice	
	2. Rule-based ethics
		Based on universal rules
		Aboslute, independent of consequence, apply to all, not self-defeating, consistent
		If inconsistent (EX no lie vs no harm), must accept that people can break rules at you
		EGBC mostly rule-based
	3. Virtues ethics
		Find "golden mean" between two extremes of virtue
		EX honesty in between habitual lying and boasting
Ethics
	Framework for studying dilemas using ethical norms
	Morality = private, ethics = external
	Decide personal morality vs professional ethics vs legal issue based on scenario
	Professional ethics #1: public needs beore own
		Public = people without knowledge
	Ethical issues are dilemma, unstructured, uncertain, involve emtion
		
The EGBC Act and Code of Ethics

Professional Engineering (EGBC)
	Council + Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board
	Exams to test experience + technical exp
	Licensed, get certificated and seal
	EIT = have degree, no 4 years experience yet
	Only seal work by self or under direct supervision
	Licensed = practice, not license = do
	Company assume liability, else find out
Using Code of Ethics
	Principle #1: no harm public
	Violate principles usually result in principle #1 violation

Davies' Thinking Like an Engineer

II The Possibility of Engineering Ethics
	Code of ethics = convention between professionals
	Use for: reduce personal risk, cartel good behaviour
III Why Obey One's Professional Code
	Cannot be:
		1. "Promise", because any engineer can not join profession, and code != law
		2. "Society", because society use law, and law doesn't enforce
		Also, law != rational, law != moral
	Therefore, must be:
		Code of Ethics are good common sense
		Hard to follow if called "personal", so defer responsibility
		If accept one code for benefit, must accept all code to form cartel
IV Interpreting a Code of Ethics
	Example: what is "public"?
	Cannot be:
		Everyone, because too weak, some high danger can average out with no danger
		Anyone, because too strong, all projects have risk
	Therefore, must be:
		Anyone without informed consent
V Professional Responsibilities
	Also have to support code (ex: harrass people who don't follow it):
		1. Protect public from risks
		2. Easier to follow code, stronger cartel
		3. Remove guilt
		4. Fairness to benefits gained from other engineers following code
